		<h2>Yoimiya Details</h2>
	<p>Yoimiya's name is renowned throughout Hanamizaka.

She is the most skilled pyrotechnician in Inazuma and is known as the "Queen of the Summer Festival."

Yoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of "Naganohara", is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.

In addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the "heroic sister" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.

Be it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.

The children are not the only ones she helps â€” as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.

Splendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.</p>
