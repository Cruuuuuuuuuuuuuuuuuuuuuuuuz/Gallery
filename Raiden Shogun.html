		<h2>Raiden Shogun</h2>
		<p>Raiden Shogun, also known as the "Plane of Euthymia", is the Electro Archon and ruler of Inazuma. She is a composed and enigmatic figure who values order and authority. Despite her aloof demeanor, Raiden Shogun is a formidable fighter and possesses tremendous power, as well as an unwavering commitment to her people and their well-being.</p>

	<h2>Raiden Shogun Details</h2>
	<p>Since the dawn of life, humankind has always borne an intense yearning for and curiosity about the world. This is the anchor point of their cognition and is the foundation of all reason.

The world of the people of Inazuma is also thus. There, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain were primordial facts of life, as well as light, and the sea... and the Raiden Shogun.

Babes nestling in their mothers' arms hear tales of the Shogun's slaying of many gods and conquering of other races.

When young men and women roam the islands, they see the gorge split asunder by a blade of lightning and the pale, still-standing bones of the giant snake.

Soldiers take to the battlefield with "glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign!" upon their lips.

The people work in contentment and peace, knowing that the Shogun and her loyal Tri-Commission are there.

The great name of the Raiden Shogun has long shaken off the shackles of mere life, becoming the eternal traditional belief of Inazuma.

People trust in this great name and its might, believing that their descendants shall witness the same sights, that the same faith will form the foundations of their inner worlds, and that this will pass on from generation to generation.

This is the eternal paradise that the Almighty Shogun promised her people.</p>
